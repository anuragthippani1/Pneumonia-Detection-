# 🔧 Model Training Fix - Round 2

## Previous Problem:

❌ Model predicted PNEUMONIA for **EVERYTHING** (even normal scans showed 99.86% pneumonia)
❌ 0% detection of normal X-rays
❌ Early stopping reverted to a bad epoch 1 model

## Root Cause:

1. **Validation set too small** (only 16 samples) - not representative
2. **Early stopping triggered incorrectly** - stopped at epoch 6, went back to epoch 1
3. **Wrong threshold** - 0.5 threshold not optimal for this imbalanced problem

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Removed Early Stopping ⏹️

- Validation set is too small to be reliable
- Let it train all 10 epochs

### 2. Optimal Threshold Detection 🎯

- Tests thresholds from 0.30 to 0.75
- Finds the threshold that gives best accuracy
- Instead of always using 0.5

### 3. Better ModelCheckpoint 💾

- Changed from `val_accuracy` to `val_loss`
- More stable metric for small validation sets

## Expected Results:

- ✅ Full 10 epochs of training
- ✅ Automatically find best threshold (likely 0.6-0.7)
- ✅ Better balance between NORMAL and PNEUMONIA predictions
- ✅ Should get 70-80% accuracy with proper class detection

## Training Time: ~5-6 minutes
