# üöÄ Model Training Improvements

## What Was Fixed

### ‚ùå Previous Issues:

1. **Imbalanced predictions** - Model predicted PNEUMONIA 85% of the time
2. **Low accuracy** - Only 57.85% test accuracy
3. **Poor NORMAL detection** - Only detected 15% of normal X-rays correctly
4. **Weak model** - Simple architecture with small filters

### ‚úÖ New Improvements:

#### 1. **Class Weight Balancing** ‚öñÔ∏è

- Added automatic class weight calculation
- Balances the imbalanced dataset (more pneumonia than normal cases)
- Forces model to learn both classes equally well

#### 2. **Better Model Architecture** üèóÔ∏è

- Increased filter sizes: 16‚Üí32, 32‚Üí64, 64‚Üí128
- Added BatchNormalization for stable training
- Added extra Dense layer (256 ‚Üí 128) for better feature learning
- Total improvement: ~2x more parameters

#### 3. **More Training Time** ‚è±Ô∏è

- Increased from 5 ‚Üí 10 epochs
- Allows model to learn more complex patterns

#### 4. **Expected Results** üìä

- **Better balance** between NORMAL and PNEUMONIA predictions
- **Higher accuracy** (targeting 75-85%)
- **Fewer false positives** (won't predict pneumonia for everything)

## Training Time

- **Previous:** ~2 minutes (5 epochs, lightweight)
- **New:** ~5-6 minutes (10 epochs, improved architecture)

## How to Train

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python train_model.py
```

## What to Expect

The model will:

1. Calculate class weights (NORMAL will have higher weight)
2. Train for 10 epochs with balanced learning
3. Save the best model based on validation accuracy
4. Generate confusion matrix and training history plots

After training, predictions should be much more accurate!
